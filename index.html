            <p class="about-text">The Heritage School was founded by the Kalyan Bharti Trust in
                2001, with the unique aim of holistically nurturing every student.
                Today, it has created global individuals, well-rounded in
                academics, sports, and extracurriculars. <br><br>
                
                Our school has a living, breathing atmosphere of conceptual
                learning and teamwork. It truly believes in its motto “Atma
                Deepo Bhava" (“Be your own light"). Every part of the school
                embodies its students' versatile minds - from the student-made
                artwork on pillars, the active sports fields, the framed paintings
                on walls, and the music and dance rituals which often
                reverberate through the campus. <br><br>
                
                Our school values integrity and compassion as much as it values
                knowledge and intelligence. It upholds the concept of collective
                education of the mind, body and soul. Recognized as the Best
                Co-Educational School in West Bengal by Education World for
                six years in a row, The Heritage School has successfully built
                youngsters with the zeal to seek answers and the drive to
                change the world

            <p class="para-text">The phoenix rises from its ashes again as The Heritage
                School announces the twelfth edition of Youthopia. A
                confluence of the words Youth and Utopia, it celebrates the
                potential of the new generation. The fest is known for
                scintillating performances which synchronize with the beats
                of our hearts and leave a soul-touching impact. Youthopia
                prides itself on being the most inclusive fest in the city.
                There are on-stage, offstage, on-field and off-field events. It
                is an amalgamation of vision, determination & excellence
                pumped up with youthful exuberance. <br><br>
                
                It facilitates fresh opinions, new events, sky-high adrenaline,
                and a lot of fun. It also reminds us of our capabilities and
                responsibilities as the next global citizens. Most of all, it is an
                unforgettable experience. As you lose yourself in the raw
                talent and collaboration, you will feel like you are rising with
                the Phoenix, too.

                    months, and their hard work will culminate into three days of pure magic!
                    The objective of this delightful fest is to have young people from all over the world to
                    participate, interact with each other, become friends, learn each other’s cultures, and respect
                    the value system followed in their part of the world. <br><br>

                <p class="message-text">Ever since I have been in this school and have watched my seniors organise this brilliant fest, my only wish has been to experience all the excitement of planning and execution, the thrill that comes with being at the helm of such a huge event first hand, and what better way than to have run for president and won! It is such an honour to be the first female President of Youthopia. To others, Youthopia might just be the most grand fest in all of Kolkata but to us Heritans, this festival is so much more than that. To us, being able to actively invest our time and effort and serve our school brings us immense joy and pride. As much as I would have preferred to have had the opportunity to manage this magnificent event in person, my team and I are working just as hard to make this a success online. The amount of work that our industrious and resourceful team is putting in to make Youthopia more electrifying than it has ever been is immense. Principal ma’am has had enough faith in me to endow upon me the authority and position of President, and I hope I have been able to live upto that. I could not be more thankful for this opportunity. We know that Youthopia 2021 is going to be the best online fest there has ever been or ever will be!  So fasten your seat belts and get ready to be blown away by the result of our months of perseverance, immaculate performances and the  outstanding talent you’re about to witness!</p>

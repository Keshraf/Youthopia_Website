            <h2>Day 1</h2>
            <hr align="left" class = "under-day">
            <p>For hundreds of years, mankind has endorsed the beauty in art- to console those
                who are lost and to enchant those who live. In Youthopiaâ€™21, we dream of exploring
                the same beauty in you through the language of food. Let your imagination take
                flight on the empty canvas that a cake is, to delight our sense of taste and sight. The
                Heritage School invites you to re-explore the art of France in your 8-inch world by
                translating your own aesthetic in Galerie de Gateau- our Cake Decorating Event.

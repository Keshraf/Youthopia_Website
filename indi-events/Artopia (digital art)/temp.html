            <h2>Digital Art</h2>
            <p>Digital art is an artistic work or practice that uses digital
                technology as part of the creative or presentation process. Since
                the 1960s, various names have been used to describe the process,
                including computer art and multimedia art. Digital art is itself
                placed under the larger umbrella term new media art. The
                techniques of digital art are used extensively by the mainstream
                media in advertisements, and by film-makers to produce visual
                effects. Desktop publishing has had a huge impact on the
                publishing world, although that is more related to graphic design.
